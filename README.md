# User-Driven-Game-Management-System-C-Programming-Lab-
The goal is to create a simple board game rating system.

Users can log in either as admin or regular user.

Admins can add or remove users.

Users can add, rate, remove, and search board games.

All data is saved to and loaded from a text file.

The program uses arrays and structs to store data.

No global variables are allowed.

Admin can list all users and their ratings.

A user can see and manage only their own games.

Ratings are whole numbers from 1 to 10.

Usernames and game names must be a single word (max 40 characters).

Maximum 30 users and 20 games per user are allowed.

The interface is entirely text-based in the terminal.

The program must be well-structured with clear function separation.
